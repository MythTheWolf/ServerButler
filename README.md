# Server Butler

The last Server Management plugin you'll ever need!

## Getting Started
There's multiple branches of ServerButler:
 1) The "master" branch
    - This will always be the latest (supported) version of spigot.
    - This is the latest stable build, not having any untested code in it.
    
 2) The "dev-{spigot version}" branches
    - These branches contains the in-development plugin source. 
    - You may still build and run these branches, but they are not guaranteed to function!
